This repository contains a Python application, Stock_Marketing.py, that simulates a real-time stock market trading environment with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using tkinter.

Key Features:

Simulated Live Market Data: The application provides dynamic, simulated real-time share price updates for a wide array of companies across diverse sectors, including IT, Finance, Automotive, Pharma, Energy, and more.

Trading Functionality: Users can buy and sell shares, with transaction fees applied to each operation.

Portfolio Management: Track your current holdings, their values, and your overall balance within the simulation.

Risk Management Tools: Implement stop-loss and take-profit orders to automate selling based on price thresholds.

Interactive Visualizations: View historical share price data through integrated matplotlib plots.

News Event Impact: Simulated news events can influence share prices, adding a layer of realism to the market dynamics.

Data Persistence: User portfolio and market data are saved using JSON for continuity across sessions.

This project serves as an excellent example of building a desktop application with Python for financial simulation and GUI development.
